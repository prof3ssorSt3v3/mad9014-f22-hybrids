# String Exercises

Create a single JavaScript file to complete all of these exercises. Add comments above each section to indicate the question number. The [MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) should be your first reference for doing these exercises.

Eg:

```js
//exercise 1

//exercise 2
```

## Exercises

1. Create a function that accepts a String as an argument and returns a new String where any space, period, or hyphen has been replaced with an underscore (\_).
2. Create a function that accepts a String as an argument and returns the first word from the String in lowercase. Eg: If `Hello my name is Jeffrey Lebowski` is sent to the function `hello` would be returned.
3. Create a function that accepts a Number as an argument, converts the Number to a String, and then uses the `padStart()` method to make sure that the String has at least 20 characters. The filler text is the number zero.
4. Create a function that accepts a String as an argument. It then uses the `includes()` method to determine if the String contains an `@` sign. If it does, then use the `indexOf` method to determine the position in the String of the `@` sign. The function will return `false` if there is no `@` sign or the position integer if one does exist.
5. Create a function that accepts a sentence as a String argument. Then use the `split` method to break apart the sentence into an array of words. The function returns the array of words.
