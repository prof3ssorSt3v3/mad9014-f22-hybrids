List of Hybrid exercises for MAD9014 in Fall 2022

Each of the other markdown files in this folder represent another section of the Hybrid Exercises.

Each file has a set of five exercises for a different topic.

You can submit them, in any order, at any time up to the end of week 12. I highly recommend that you submit as many of them as soon as you can.

The suggested order for the exercises is:

1. variables-datatypes.md
2. control-flow.md
3. functions.md
4. math-numbers.md
5. strings.md
6. arrays.md
7. objects.md

**Remember**: The only way to learn to program is by actually writing code.
