List of Hybrid exercises for MAD9014 in Fall 2022

Each of the other markdown files in this folder represent another section of the Hybrid Exercises.

Each file has a set of five exercises for a different topic.

You can submit them, in any order. I highly recommend that you submit as many of them as soon as you can.

> You must submit at least 4 of them before the Reading Week (the end of Week 7).

The suggested order for the exercises is:

1. variables-datatypes.md
2. control-flow.md
3. functions.md
4. math-numbers.md
5. strings.md
6. date-time.md
7. arrays.md
8. objects.md

**Remember**: The only way to learn to program is by actually writing code.
