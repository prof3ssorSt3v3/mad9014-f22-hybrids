# Variables and DataTypes

Create a single JavaScript file to complete all three of these exercises. Add comments above each section to indicate the question number.

Eg:

```js
//question 1

//question 2

//question 3
```

## Exercises

1. Declare 5 **meaningfully named** variables using `let`. Then assign values to the variables as needed so that there is one of each type: `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`, `undefined`, and `null`.
2. Declare two variables with Primitive values. One whose value can be changed and one whose value cannot be changed.
3. Copy the following code snippet that declares two variables and then add the code that would let you **trade** the values inside the two variables. After your code runs the value in `first` should be 42 and the value in `second` should be 7. You need to do this without writing the numbers 7 or 42 in your code. Use another variable to temporarily hold one of the values while swapping.

```js
let first = 7;
let second = 42;
```

## Submission

Copy and paste the contents of your whole JavaScript File into the text box in the Variable Hybrid Assignment in BS LMS.
