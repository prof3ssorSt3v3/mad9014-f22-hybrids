# Date Time Exercises

Create a single JavaScript file to complete all of these exercises. Add comments above each section to indicate the question number. The [MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) should be your first reference for doing these exercises.

Eg:

```js
//exercise 1

//exercise 2
```

## Exercises

1. Write a function that will create a Date Object with today's date. Change its month to September. Change the year to 1980. Then output just the Date, no time values.
2. Create a single Date Object with the current date and time. Update the time to 4:00pm Ottawa time. Output the time in both Ottawa time AND GMT/UTC time.
3. Write a function that will accept an integer argument as a number of seconds. Convert that integer into three integers - one for the hours, one for the minutes, one for the seconds. Then display the seconds as a clock-like display `00:00:00` with hours minutes and seconds.
4. Write a function that will accept two Date objects as arguments and then returns the number of DAYS between the two dates.
5. Write a function that will accept an integer argument. As long as the value of the integer is greater than zero the function should call itself recursively after 1 second (1000 milliseconds). Use `setTimeout()` to call the function after the one second. This code will effectively run forever. To stop the code running eventually, reduce the amount being passed each time the function is called. OR you can check to see if a number is being passed into the function. If no number is being passed into the function then don't call it recursively.
