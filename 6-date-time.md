# Date Time Exercises

Create a single JavaScript file to complete all of these exercises. Add comments above each section to indicate the question number. The [MDN website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) should be your first reference for doing these exercises.

Eg:

```js
//exercise 1

//exercise 2
```

## Exercises

1. Write a function that will create a Date Object with today's date. Change its month to September. Change the year to 1980. Then output just the Date, no time values.
2. Create a Date Object with the current date and time. Update the time to 4:00pm Ottawa time. Output the time in both Ottawa time AND GMT/UTC time.
3. Write a function that will accept an integer argument as a number of seconds. Then display the seconds as a clock-like display `00:00:00` with hours minutes and seconds.
4. Write a function that will accept two Date objects as arguments and then returns the number of DAYS between the two dates.
5. Write a function that will accept an integer argument. As long as the value of the integer is greater than zero the function should call itself recursively after 1 second (1000 milliseconds). Use `setTimeout()` to call the function after the one second.
