# Function Exercises

Create a single JavaScript file to complete all six of these exercises. Add comments above each section to indicate the question number.

Eg:

```js
//exercise 1

//exercise 2
```

## Exercises

1. Write a function declaration that uses `console.log` to write a message and then returns `undefined`.
2. Write a function declaration that accepts two arguments and returns a Boolean value.
3. Write a function expression that accepts three arguments but has default values for two of them.
4. Write a function expression that returns another function.
5. Write an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that returns your name and assigns the return value to a variable called `name`.
6. Rewrite these two functions as an arrow function.

```js
let f1 = function () {
  console.log('This is function one');
};
let f2 = function () {
  console.log('This is function two');
};
```
